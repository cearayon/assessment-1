// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Planning
// Analysis of Requirements
// Design
// Implementation
// Testing & Integration
// Maintain
//repeat for addional features/reqs


//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the 
    values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you. 
*/
const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 

const analysisOfRequirements = 'defining scope of work for the application to accomplish and what is required of it. will involved stakeholders, internal and external. will define resources needed to complete project.'

const design = 'Designs the system and logic that defines how the software will be coded. How will we build this software?'

const implementation = 'where actual coding and development happens based on previously established requirements and design structure. this is where the process can veer of the original agreed upon terms as each dev is unique in their interpretation of reqs and solutions'

const testingAndIntegratation = 'bug testing and fixing. does the software accomplish our goals? if not, fix until it meets requirements. if product meets requirements and design standards, deploy to production phase and distribute amongst clients and consumers (market). can also deploy to testing/staging for extra QA before sending to market.'

const maintain = 'no software or product is 100%. if anything breaks during market release, code has to be maintained and fixed. as demand and requirements change from the market, updates and patches need to be created in order to meet them.'
